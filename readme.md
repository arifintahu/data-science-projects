# Data Science Projects

### Some projects that I've done
### [1. Forecasting Daily Solar Power Generation Using Gaussian Naive Bayes](./solar-power-generation/solar-power-generation.ipynb)
- This project uses dataset "Solar Power Generation Data" from kaggle. The dataset contains two solar power plants in India over a 34 day period. It has two pairs of files - each pair has one power generation dataset and one sensor readings dataset.
- The power generation datasets are gathered at the inverter level - each inverter has multiple lines of solar panels attached to it. The sensor data is gathered at a plant level single array of sensors optimally placed at the plant.
- Can we predict the power generation for next couple of days? - this allows for better grid management
